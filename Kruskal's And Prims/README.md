# Kruskal's Algorithm
It is used to find minimum spanning tree in a graph.It is based on greedy technique.                      The graph given must be undirected and weighted.Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm works only for undirected graphs.

 ### A graph is called a tree if there is no cycles present
 
     Steps Involved :-
     1.First find the edge with minimum weight.
     2.Select this edge in minimum spanning tree if and only if after                                          inserting this edge there is no cycle formed.
     - Cycle formed can be checked by either DFS,BFS or Union Find By Rank
